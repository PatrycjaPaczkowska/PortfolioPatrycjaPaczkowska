   "description": "I graduated from IT School in ZS im. Bohaterów Września z 1939 Roku w Ilawie, passed the E.12, E.13, E.14 exams and went abroad to build a financial cushion. All this to become a Front-End Developer without studying. For this purpose, I learned from online courses such as 'From basic to the FrontEnd Developer' course by Bartłomiej Borowczyk and 'UX & UI - the art of useful design'. Besides all that, my hobby is painting.",
